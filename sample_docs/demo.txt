RAG MVP Demo Document

This project demonstrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
RAG works by retrieving the most relevant chunks from your documents and using them as sources for the model.

Key ideas:
- Documents are split into chunks.
- Chunks are embedded and stored in a vector database (Postgres + pgvector).
- A user question is embedded and compared to chunk embeddings using cosine distance.
- The system retrieves the top-k chunks and answers using ONLY those sources.

Example facts for testing:
- The project uses Docker Compose to run Postgres + pgvector locally.
- The API has endpoints for ingesting text and PDFs, listing documents, selecting a document, and asking questions.
