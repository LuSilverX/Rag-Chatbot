Infra Notes (Demo)

Why Docker for the database:
- It keeps local setup consistent across machines.
- Postgres + pgvector can be started with one command using Docker Compose.
- No need to manually install Postgres or the pgvector extension.
- Data persists across restarts if Docker volumes are used.

Vector search:
- Each chunk has an embedding vector.
- We store embeddings in pgvector and compute cosine distance during retrieval.
- Smaller distance means the chunk is more relevant to the question.
